### The Ultimate SvelteKit + Prismic Starter Theme

Simplify your development process with PrelteKit. This innovative starter theme is specifically designed for developers, seamlessly integrating SvelteKit with the CMS Prismic. With a pre-configured setup, you can dive right into creating exceptional web applications. Harnessing the power of Tailwind CSS and a vast collection of atomic components, PrelteKit streamlines development, allowing you to focus on crafting remarkable user experiences. Say goodbye to tedious setup and hello to efficient, intuitive development with PrelteKit.

Here's a list of everything it has to offer:

- 🔧 Setup for Prismic, so it has all the fields which are needed to create a website
- 🚦 Routing is set up and works automatically
- 🔍 SEO component
- 📱 Basic responsive for tablet and mobile
- 🧱 Atomic components for images, text, links, and videos
- 🎨 Images automatically have lazyload and get pulled from Prismic in the correct size
- 📽️ Vimeo player with controls, responsive videos possible
- 🚀 Automatically deploys on Netlify
- 🔨 Other extra useful components for layout (e.g., accordion, two-column scroll)
- 🔗 Navigation for desktop and mobile already set up
- 🔝 2 Level navigation (dropdown) possible
- 🎦 Basic image slider set up
- 🧩 Uses slices to enable a flexible structure of the website for the editor
- ⚙️ Good for highly customized websites but also for blogs, shops, or portfolios

## Getting started

With node installed, run the following command;

```bash
  npx prismic-cli@latest theme --theme-url https://github.com/marius-jopen/preltekit
```

This command will install the template on your computer and will spin up a clean Prismic backend for you.
You will now be prompted for some installation options.

The repo you end up with is connected to the official Preltekit demo backend.
Populate your own backend with data before switching over.

## Next steps

1. Add data to your backend
2. Switch over to your data

In the file `prismic-configuration.js` you can remove the line that says preltekit and uncomment the one that has your repo's name. You are now working with your own data!

From where I'm standing it looks like you're done, 🧴 enjoy the sun!
